# social-media-platform

This is a social media platform which allows users to follow other people, create posts, publish comments and send messages. 

Note: I have already create an account. I advise to follow this test account after creating a new account. After logging into new account, we can search for 'wangxing' in the search bar and then click 'following'. Then we can get back to the 'Home' to see the posts. You can also try to log into this test account.

TestAccount: wangxing@gmail.com
password: Lyz199991

Steps:
1: clone this repo to local
2: use 'npm install' command to install necessary packages
3: run 'npm run dev'ï¼Œ then this application will run in localhost:3000
4: Register an account and try to follow my suggested test account(wangxing) in social media. You need to search for other users through search bar before following them.
5: create your own posts or publish comments in posts. You can also send messages to other account, but you need to find that account through search bar before sending messages.
